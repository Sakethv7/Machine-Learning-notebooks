# ML Notebooks

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of machine learning notebooks that focus on training models to predict various factors like prices and GDP. The notebooks demonstrate the use of built-in Python libraries and models such as Linear Regression to explore these predictions. The aim is to apply machine learning techniques for practical prediction tasks and analyze the results.

## Project Files
- **percapitaincomepredict.ipynb**: Trains a model to predict per capita income using a dataset of relevant features.
- **predictprice.ipynb**: Uses machine learning models to predict prices based on input data, showcasing techniques like linear regression.

## Key Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements models like Linear Regression for predicting outcomes such as prices and GDP.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes datasets to prepare features and fit predictive models.
- **Model Training**: Demonstrates model training and evaluation using standard Python libraries.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebooks, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
